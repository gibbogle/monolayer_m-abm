To run PEST using the cluster
-----------------------------

All the PEST executable files must exist in /home/USERNAME/bin, and this directory must be in the path,
OR (if possible) /home/mbog002/bin must be in the path (assuming that the user is permitted to execute programs there)
OR the PEST files could be located in /gpfs1m/projects/uoa00014/pest/bin

0. Use a text editor to create the *.tpl template files.
   A template file is the model input file for the experiment with the value of each parameter which is to be fitted
   replaced by "$ PARAMID $", where PARAMID is the short ID code for the parameter (see pester_manual.docx).
   
1. Use pester.xlsm to create all the other input files, including batch.config and run_pest.sh

2. Start MobaXterm, login to the cluster

3. Copy the input files to the NeSI directory where PEST will be invoked.
   These are:
       *.tpl
	   *.out.ins
	   MODEL.pst (e.g. monolayer_m.pst)
	   batch.config
	   run_pest.sh
   This directory must contain:
       run_sbatch.sh
	   run_simulations.sh
	   
4. cd to the directory where PEST will be invoked

5. ./run_sbatch.sh

6. Check the status of the batch job with 'squ'.  If necessary, cancel the job with 'scancel JOBID'

7. When the job has completed, copy the Run Record file (*.rec) back to Windows.
   The results are in the section 'OPTIMISATION RESULTS'

   
 File copying
 ------------
 
To use the file copying batch file, pscp.exe must be in the Windows PATH.
pscp.exe (part of PuTTY) can be used to copy a file from Windows to NeSI, e.g:
 
 pscp -pw PASSWORD test.txt USER@login.uoa.nesi.org.nz:/home/USER/.
 
 copies test.txt to the user's home directory, /home/USER.  pscp.exe must be in the PATH.
